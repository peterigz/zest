# Getting Started

Welcome to Zest! This section will help you get up and running with Zest quickly.

## What is Zest?

Zest is a lightweight Vulkan rendering library designed to simplify GPU programming while maintaining full control over the rendering pipeline. Unlike heavy game engines, Zest provides just enough abstraction to be productive without hiding important details.

## Core Philosophy

- **Simplicity** - Single header file, minimal dependencies
- **Transparency** - You always know what's happening under the hood
- **Efficiency** - Frame graph compilation, resource pooling, bindless descriptors
- **Flexibility** - Use as much or as little of the library as you need

## In This Section

1. **[Installation](installation.md)** - Build Zest and run the examples
2. **[First Application](first-application.md)** - Create your first Zest application step by step
3. **[Architecture Overview](architecture.md)** - Understand Device, Context, and Frame Graph

## Recommended Reading Order

If you're new to Zest:

1. Start with [Installation](installation.md) to get the examples building
2. Follow [First Application](first-application.md) to understand the basic structure
3. Read [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to grasp the core concepts
4. Then explore [Concepts](../concepts/index.md) for deeper understanding
5. Follow [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) to build practical knowledge
